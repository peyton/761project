ELLE
MAGAZINE
EDITOR
JEAN-DOMINIQUE
BAUBY
FELLED
BY
A
MASSIVE
STROKE
AT
AGE
BAUBY
WAS
LEFT
FULLY
CONSCIOUS
BUT
COMPLETELY
PARALYZED
SAVE
FOR
THE
ABILITY
TO
ROTATE
HIS
HEAD
AND
BLINK
HIS
LEFT
EYE
<S>
IT
WAS
BY
BLINKING
IN
REACTION
TO
AN
INGENIOUS
ALPHABET
SYSTEM
DEVISED
BY
ONE
OF
HIS
SPEECH
THERAPISTS
THAT
BAUBY
WAS
EVENTUALLY
ABLE
TO
DICTATE
HIS
BOOK
IF
SUCH
AWARDS
WERE
DETERMINED
ON
THE
BASIS
OF
QUANTITY
ALONE
THERE'D
BE
NO
QUESTION
THAT
SCHNABEL'S
WAS
DESERVED

IS
MORE
DIRECTING

<S>
THE
MOVIE'S
CENTRAL
GIMMICK AND
MAKE
NO
MISTAKE
IT'S
A
GIMMICK IS
THAT
FOR
LARGE
CHUNKS
OF
THE
RUNNING
TIME
WE
SEE
THINGS
AS
SCHNABEL
IMAGINES
BAUBY
PLAYED
BY
MATHIEU
AMALRIC
SAW
THEM
FROM
A
FIXED
PERSPECTIVE

ORGY
OF

DISTORTED

<S>
IN

ATROPHIED

INSIDE-OUT

DEVISED

EVEN
WHEN

SUBJECTIVE

<S>
OR
LAPSES
INTO
FLASHBACKS
FROM
BAUBY'S
PRE-STROKE
LIFE
HE
EMPLOYS
THE
SAME
RAMPANT
OVERSTYLIZATION
<S>
IT'S
THE
MOST
SENSUALLY
ASSAULTING
MOVIE
IN
RECENT
MEMORY
WITH
THE
POSSIBLE
EXCEPTION
OF
MICHAEL
BAY
S
TRANSFORMERS
AND
YET
MANY
OF
THE
SAME
PEOPLE
WHO
CRITICIZED
BAY
FOR
HIS
ATTENTION-DEFICIENT
AESTHETICS
ARE
FALLING
OVER
EACH
OTHER
TO
PRAISE
SCHNABEL
<S>
WHY
BECAUSE
INSTEAD
OF
RANSACKING
THE
STOREHOUSE
OF
COMMERCIAL
ADVERTISING
FOR
HIS
INSPIRATION
HE
STEALS
HIS
VISUAL
TRICKS
FROM
MORE
HIGHFALUTIN
SOURCES
LIKE
FELLINI
AND
STAN
BRAKHAGE
OF
COURSE
BAUBY'S
STORY
IS
REMARKABLE
<S>
ONLY
NOT
JUST
FOR
THE
REASONS
THAT
SCHNABEL
AND
HIS
SCREENWRITER
RONALD
HARWOOD
KEEP
TELLING
US
<S>
THE
MOVIE
FOCUSES
SO
NARROWLY
ON
THE
IDEA
OF
COMMUNICATION ON
HOW
BAUBY
DESPITE
HIS
CONDITION
MANAGES
TO
RE-ESTABLISH
CONTACT
WITH
THE
OUTSIDE
WORLD THAT
IT'S
AS
IF
MY
LEFT
FOOT
HAD
NEVER
MOVED
BEYOND
ITS
EARLY
SCENE
OF
PALSY-STRICKEN
AUTHOR
AND
PAINTER
CHRISTY
BROWN
PICKING
UP
A
PIECE
OF
CHALK
BETWEEN
HIS
TOES
AND
WRITING
FOR
THE
FIRST
TIME
<S>
BUT
WHAT
MADE
MY
LEFT
FOOT
GREAT
WAS
THE
SENSE
THAT
BEING
CONFINED
TO
A
WHEELCHAIR
IN
NO
WAY
ENNOBLED
BROWN
OR
DIMINISHED
THE
MESSY
TANGLE
OF
HIS
PERSONAL
LIFE
<S>
MUCH
THE
SAME
COULD
BE
SAID
OF
BAUBY
A
BON
VIVANT
WHO
AT
THE
TIME
OF
HIS
STROKE
HAD
RECENTLY
SEPARATED
FROM
THE
MOTHER
OF
HIS
THREE
YOUNG
CHILDREN
AND
MOVED
IN
WITH
ANOTHER
MISTRESS
<S>
BUT
THE
DELICIOUS
IDEA
OF
THESE
TWO
BEAUTIES
CONTINUING
TO
VIE
FOR
BAUBY'S
AFFECTIONS
EVEN
IN
HIS
SEMI-VEGETATIVE
STATE WHEREUPON
THEY
ARE
JOINED
BY
A
PARADE
OF
HEART-STOPPINGLY
GORGEOUS
THERAPISTS
AND
PATHOLOGISTS IS
TOUCHED
ON
BY
SCHNABEL
AND
HARWOOD
ONLY
FLEETINGLY
CHIEFLY
DURING
ONE
EXTRAORDINARY
SCENE
NOT
IN
THE
BOOK
IN
WHICH
BAUBY
MUST
PREVAIL
ON
HIS
FORMER
LOVER
THE
SUPERB
EMMANUELLE
SEIGNER
TO
TRANSLATE
FOR
HIM
DURING
A
TELEPHONE
CALL
TO
HIS
CURRENT
FLAME

THERE
ARE
A
HANDFUL
OF

AFFECTING
MOMENTS
SCATTERED
THROUGHOUT
INCLUDING
TWO
SCENES
FEATURING
MAX
VON
SYDOW
AS
BAUBY'S
92-YEAR-OLD
FATHER
<S>
THEY
WORK
IN
A
WAY
THE
REST
OF
THE
FILM
DOESN'T
BECAUSE
SCHNABEL
WHO
HIMSELF
HAS
FIVE
CHILDREN
FROM
TWO
MARRIAGES
AND
CARED
FOR
HIS
OWN
NONAGENARIAN
FATHER
TOWARD
THE
END
OF

LIFE
SEEMS
TO
BE
COMMUNING
WITH

SUBJECT
ON
A

TOO
OFTEN

THE

BELL
AND

BUTTERFLY
FEELS
GROTESQUELY
CALCULATED

THE
MORE
SCHNABEL
RATCHETS
UP
THE
INSPIRATIONAL
PLATITUDES
OF
EXACTLY
THE
SORT
THAT
BAUBY WHO
MAINTAINED
AN
ACERBIC
SENSE
OF
HUMOR
ABOUT
HIS
SITUATION
UNTIL
THE
VERY
END WOULD
HAVE
DESPISED
<S>
THE
INELEGANT
YET
FUNCTIONAL
NAME
OF
BAUBY'S
RARE
CONDITION
WAS
LOCKED-IN
SYNDROME
AND
HERE
TOO
THERE'S
A
VASTLY
MORE
INTRIGUING
MOVIE

SOMEWHERE
BENEATH

<S>
IN

STARTED
THE

A
DECADE

IN
A

MOST

19-YEAR-OLD
ROBERT

AFFLECK
WHOSE
WIMPY

UNEMPHATIC

HE
CAN'T

JESSE

BOTH
APPALLED

AMUSED
AT

POINT
TAUNTING
BOB
WITH
THE
QUESTION
YOU
WANT
TO
BE
LIKE
ME
OR
YOU
WANT
TO
BE
ME
ALTHOUGH
ARRESTINGLY
DIFFERENT
FROM
THE

PIC
INITIALLY
FEELS
OVER-ELABORATED
<S>
SHOTS
IN
WHICH
THE
EDGES
ARE
PURPOSELY
BLURRED
AND
A
SOUNDTRACK
TOO
CONSPICUOUSLY
MIXED
TO
EMPHASIZE
AMBIENT
SOUNDS
OF
INSECTS
AND
WEATHER
WARN
OF
INCIPIENT
PRETENSION
<S>
FEARS
ALSO
GATHER
THAT
DOMINIK
HAS
NO
INTENTION
OF
SUPPLYING
THE
FILM
WITH
ENOUGH
DRAMATIC
TRACTION
TO
SUSTAIN
INTEREST
OVER
THE
LONG
HAUL

THE
DELIBERATE

DESIGNED
TO
ACCOMMODATE
NUMEROUS
EMBELLISHMENTS

DIGRESSIONS
<S>
BUT
ANY
SENSE
OF

IMPATIENCE
IS
SOON
OVERTAKEN
BY
THE

ACCUMULATION
OF

ON

NARRATIVE
HISTORICAL
FOLKLORIC
BEHAVIORAL

PSYCHOLOGICAL
<S>
PITCHING

THE

SKIPS
AND
MEANDERS
AMONG

WHOSE
RELEVANCE
AND

MAY
BE
INITIALLY
UNCLEAR

WHICH
ARE

FOR

A
SELF-STYLED
LADIES
MAN
JESSE'S
SHADOW
HOVERS
OVER

ALL
AND
NARRATIVE'S
DOMINANT
PLOY
IS
THAT
THE
OTHER

ARE
CONSTANTLY
AFRAID
THAT
JESSE
NO
MATTER
WHERE
HE
IS
WILL
FIND
OUT
ABOUT
ANY
TRANSGRESSIONS
ON

AND
WILL
COME
AFTER
THEM

IN

HE
DOES

ARE
NUMBERED
<S>
HIS
ANTENNAE
FOR
SENSING
WHEN
SOMETHING
IS
AMISS
ARE
ALMOST
SUPERNATURALLY
ACUTE
AND
HE
TAKES
MORE
THAN
ONE
LONG
JOURNEY
TO
TRACK
DOWN
PEOPLE
PLOTTING
AGAINST
HIM
THE
IRONY
IS
THAT
THE
MAN
HE
REALLY
NEEDS
TO
HAVE
HIS
EYE
ON
IS
THE
ONE
CLOSEST
TO
HIM
<S>
EVENTUALLY
THE
LONG-INEFFECTUAL
AUTHORITIES
GET
INTO
THE
ACT
SETTING
IN
PLACE
THE
MECHANISM
LEADING
TO
BOB
FORD'S
ALMOST
RITUAL
KILLING
OF

AS
HE
DUSTS

THAT'S
NOT

IN

THAT

MUCH
OF

IS
CALCULATED
A

THAT
UNTIL

USES
TO

IT'S
A
LAYERED
CONTINUALLY
INTERESTING
PERFORMANCE

MAKES
AN
INDELIBLE
IMPRESSION
AS
THE
INSECURE
PHYSICALLY
UNPREPOSSESSING
WEAKLING
WHO
ENDURES
NO

OF

AND
EVENTUALLY
EMBODIES
THE

BESIDE
THE
POINT
<S>
IT'S
JUST
THE
WATERED-DOWN
GLUE
THAT
KEEPS
THE

IN

LIKE

HE
WORKS
BEST
IN

HE
WAS
CONTENT

SQUANDERED
IN
ILL-FITTING

FROM

CURIOUS
GEORGE
HE
REMINDS
THE

HE'S
THE

WORKING
<S>
ONCE

HE
STRIPS

HAVE

AS

<S>
PENN
ALSO
SEEMS

SCRAWLED
ACROSS

IN

THAT
SOMETIMES
FEELS
SELF-CONSCIOUS

WHICH
LENDS
INTO
THE

THE
SENSE
OF
EXPERIMENTATION
THAT
EMBOLDENED
THE
GREAT
AMERICAN
FILMS
OF
THE
1970S
<S>
IT
IS
A
FEELING
ENHANCED
BY
THE
PRESENCE
OF
SEVERAL
ORIGINAL
SONGS
COMPOSED
AND
PERFORMED
BY
EDDIE
VEDDER
WHICH
DO
NOT
MERELY
REGURGITATE
THE
STORY
OF
THE
FILM
BUT
IN
FACT
ARE
INTEGRAL
TO
THE
TELLING
OF
IT
<S>
MOST
OF
ALL
PENN
ALLOWS
HIRSCH
THE
SPACE
HE
NEEDS
TO
BUILD
A
PERFORMANCE
OF
ENORMOUS
PHYSICAL
AND
PSYCHOLOGICAL
RIGOR
<S>
THE
CRITICISMS
OF
INTO

ARE
EASY
TO
ANTICIPATE
<S>
IS
THE
MOVIE
TOO
LONG
PROBABLY
AT

BY
THAT
HALLOWED
YARDSTICK
THAT
SAYS
A

MUST
MOVE
RAPIDLY
FROM
POINT
A
TO
B SOMETHING
MCCANDLESS
HIMSELF
WAS
IN
NO
HURRY
TO
DO
<S>
IS
IT
LESS
THAN
JUDICIOUS
WITH
RESPECT
TO
MCCANDLESS'S
PARENTS
AND
SISTER
WHO
EXIST
IN
THE
FILM
MOSTLY
AS
FRAGMENTS
OF
MEMORY
PHANTOMS
OF
A
DISCARDED
EXISTENCE
ARGUABLY
SO
UNTIL
YOU
CONSIDER
THAT
DURING
HIS
ENTIRE
TWO
YEARS
ON
THE
ROAD
MCCANDLESS
FAILED
TO
PLACE
SO
MUCH
AS
A
SINGLE
PHONE
CALL
HOME
<S>
PART
OF
THE
ENDURING
FASCINATION
WITH
MCCANDLESS
OF
COURSE
IS
THAT
HIS

TENDS
TO
MEAN
CONSIDERABLY
DIFFERENT
THINGS
DEPENDING
ON
WHERE
YOU'RE
STANDING WHETHER
YOU
ARE
PARENT
OR
CHILD
RESTLESS
WANDERER
OR
HAPPY
CONFORMIST
<S>
PENN'S
TRIUMPH
IS
THAT
HE
MANAGES
TO
SEE
MCCANDLESS
AS
BOTH
BOY
AND
MAN
PROPHET
AND
FRAUD
VAGABOND
AND
VISIONARY
<S>
WHICH
IS

NOLAN'S
BATMAN
PLAYED
WITH
IRON-JAWED
INTENSITY
BY
CHRISTIAN
BALE
WAS
THE
PRODUCT
OF
MANY
WAYWARD
YEARS
IN
THE
WILDERNESS
FOLLOWED
BY
STILL
MORE
YEARS
OF
RIGOROUS
TRAINING
AT
THE

ONLY

WAS

READY

BATMAN
<S>
AT
WHICH
POINT
IN
A
TWIST
THAT
NOW
SEEMS
PERHAPS
A
TOUCH
TOO
SHAKESPEAREAN
BY
WAY
OF
GEORGE
LUCAS
THE
PUPIL
FOUND
HIMSELF
FORCED
TO
USE
THE
MASTER'S
TEACHINGS
AGAINST
THE
MASTER
HIMSELF
<S>
IN
THE
DARK
KNIGHT
NOTHING
IS
NEARLY
SO
CUT-AND-DRIED
<S>
WHEREAS
THE
RADICALIZED
RA'S
WITH
HIS
ARSENAL
OF
DIRTY
BOMBS
AND
HIS
URGE
TO
ERADICATE
WESTERN
DECADENCE
WAS
A
SUPERVILLAIN
OF
THE
SORT
THAT
ANYONE
WHO
READS
THE
PAPERS
HAS
BEEN
CONDITIONED
TO
EXPECT
THE
JOKER
OF
THE
DARK
KNIGHT
IS
ALL
THE
MORE
TERRIFYING
FOR
NOT

OR
AN
IDENTIFIABLE
MOTIVE

THIS
JOKER
ISN'T
THE
EBULLIENT
PRANKSTER
OF
BATMAN
MOVIES
AND
TV
SHOWS
PAST
BUT
RATHER
A
FREAKISHLY
DISTURBING
EMBODIMENT
OF
THOSE
DESTRUCTIVE
HUMAN
IMPULSES
THAT
CAN'T
SO
EASILY
BE
EXPLAINED
AWAY
<S>
HIS
ONLY
RULE
IS
TO
SHOW
OTHERS
THE
FOLLY
OF

THE
ABSURDITY
OF
STRIVING

HE
WANTS

<S>
BY
NOW
OF

YOU
KNOW

THE

IS
PLAYED
BY
HEATH
LEDGER
IN
THE
LAST

HE
COMPLETED
BEFORE
HIS
DEATH
THIS
PAST
JANUARY
AT
THE
AGE
OF

IT
IS
PERHAPS
THE
BEST
COMPLIMENT
ONE
CAN
PAY
TO
THIS
GIFTED
YOUNG
ACTOR
TO
SAY
THAT
HIS
PERFORMANCE
HERE
WOULD
HAVE
CEMENTED
HIS
LEGEND
EVEN
IF
HE'D
LIVED
TO
SEE
THE
FILM'S
RELEASE
<S>
THE
JOKER
ENTERS
INTO
THE
DARK
KNIGHT
GRADUALLY
AT
FIRST
A
TANGENTIAL
FIGURE
IN
A
NOT
PARTICULARLY
INTERESTING
MAFIA
MONEY-LAUNDERING
SUBPLOT
<S>
BUT
EVEN
THEN
LEDGER
SEEMS
TO
MAKE
THE
FILM
GROW
LARGER
WHENEVER
HE'S
ONSCREEN
NO
MATTER
IF
YOU
HAPPEN
TO
ALREADY
BE
WATCHING
IT
IN

<S>
NO

LEDGER
WAS
REPORTEDLY
EXHAUSTED
AFTER
FINISHING
WORK
ON
THE
FILM
<S>
WATCHING
HIM
YOU
CAN
SEE
HOW
DEMANDING
HE
WAS
ON
HIMSELF
HOW
MUCH
HE
REFUSED
TO
PLAY
ANY
PREDICTABLE
BEATS
WHETHER
THE
JOKER
IS
CASUALLY
ADVISING
A
ROOM
OF
ARMED
THUGS
TO
NOT
BLOW
THINGS
OUT
OF
PROPORTION
WHILE
OUTFITTED
IN
THE

GYLLENHAAL
LESS
MILQUETOAST
THAN
KATIE
HOLMES
BUT
THE
GENIUS
OF
THE
PERFORMANCE
IS
HOW
FULLY
LEDGER
CONVINCES
US
THAT
THE
JOKER
IS
CAPABLE
OF
DOING
ANYTHING
AT
ANY
MOMENT???EVEN
IF
THE
OCCASION
CALLS
FOR
IT
TO
STOP
BEING
THE
JOKER

AUTHORED
THE

HARVEY

PLAYED

KENNEDY-ESQUE
RIGHTEOUSNESS
BY
AARON
ECKHART
THAT
MAKES
THE

SOUND
LIKE
HEAVY
STUFF???AND
IT
IS
<S>
BUT
I
SHOULD
ADD
THAT
NOLAN
ALSO
DELIVERS

FROM

MICHAEL

BY

THROUGH
HIS

A

SERVANT
THROUGH

IT
WAS

HOW
LOSING

THAT
MAKES

YES
EVENTUALLY
THEY

AROUND

OVERWRITTEN

<S>
THESE
BRIEF
INTERVIEWS
WITH

HERE
IS
LOOSER

OSCAR-WORTHY
BUT
STILL
SOMEHOW
ON

THE

IS
CONFIDENTLY
POLISHED
AND
THANKFULLY
MORE
SWEET-TEMPERED
THAN
PREACHY
GIVEN
THAT
EVERY

HAS
AN

AS

LEADS

KOWALSKI
ADMITS
THAT
I
HAVE
MORE
IN

WITH
THESE
GOOKS

WITH

THUS
IS
LAUNCHED
A

SOME
AS
SO
AMBITIOUSLY
LONG
AS
TO
SEEM
FAR-FETCHED
FOR
SUCH
AN
OLD
MENTALLY
ENTRENCHED
MAN
<S>
BUT
EASTWOOD
MAKES
IT
APPEAR
PLAUSIBLE
AS

KOWALSKI
HAS
SEEN

EVERYTHING
THAT
COMES
AFTERWARD

ALMOST
PREORDAINED

HEAVIER
AND
MORE
SOBERING
THAN
EXPECTED
BUT
IT'S
QUIETLY
FORESHADOWED
BY
NARRATIVE
AND
CHARACTER
ELEMENTS
<S>
WHILE
GRAN
TORINO
IS
ENTIRELY
OF
A
PIECE
WITH
EASTWOOD'S
OTHER
WORK
IT
ALSO
STANDS
APART
FROM
HIS
ARTFUL
FILMS
OF
THE
PAST
SIX
YEARS
IN
ITS
COMPLETELY
STRAIGHTFORWARD
UNSTUDIED
STYLE
<S>
TO
BE
SURE
THERE
ARE
THEMES

UNDERSTATED
POINTS
OF

MOST
FUNDAMENTALLY
ABOUT

THE
CHANGING

OF
THE

THE

EASTWOOD
COULD
BE
SAID
TO
HAVE
INADVERTENTLY
MADE
THE
FIRST
FILM
OF
THE

IN

KOWALSKI
TAKES
THAO
TO
AN
ITALIAN

WITH
THE
INTENTION
OF
MAKING
HIM
MAN

TEACHES
HIM
THE
RELEVANT

EVERYONE
SHOULD
BE
ABLE
TO
WITHSTAND
AND
HUMOROUSLY
THROW
BACK
AT

<S>
FOR

SUPERFICIALLY
ABRASIVE
ACKNOWLEDGMENT

THERE
IS
PROBABLY
NO

EASTWOOD
JUST
COMPARE

TO
JACK
