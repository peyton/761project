<S>
THOSE
ROUGHLY
ARE
THE
EVENTS
OF
RICHARD
MATHESON
S
NOVEL
I
AM
LEGEND
WHICH
HAS
BEEN
ADAPTED
FOR
THE
SCREEN
TWICE
BEFORE FIRST
AS
THE
ITALIAN-MADE
THE
LAST
MAN
ON
EARTH
WITH
VINCENT
PRICE
IN
THE
LEAD
AND
LATER
AS
THE
OMEGA
MAN
A
PIECE
OF
EARLY-'70S
PSYCHEDELIA
THAT
CAST
CHARLTON
HESTON
AS
NEVILLE
AND
TURNED
HIS
ADVERSARIES
INTO
TRENCH-COATED
SOCIAL
REVOLUTIONARIES
<S>
IN
LAWRENCE'S
VERSION
WHICH
WAS
ADAPTED
BY
SCREENWRITER
MARK
PROTOSEVICH
POSEIDON
AND
REVISED
CONSIDERABLY
BY
OSCAR-WINNER
AKIVA
GOLDSMAN
A
BEAUTIFUL
MIND
WILL
SMITH
STEPS
INTO
NEVILLE
S
SHOES
AND
IT'S
THE
FIRST
TIME
AN
ACTOR
HAS
BEEN
ASKED
OR
ALLOWED
TO
PLAY
THE
CHARACTER
AS
SOMETHING
MORE
THAN
GOD'S
LONELY
ANGRY
MAN
<S>
FOR
MUCH
OF
THE
MOVIE
IT'S
LITERALLY
A
ONE-MAN
SHOW
AS
NEVILLE
GOES
THROUGH
HIS
DAILY
ROUTINE
TEARING
ABOUT
THE
EMPTY
MANHATTAN
STREETS
IN
HIS
STRATEGICALLY
PRODUCT-PLACED
MUSTANG
SHELBY
RAIDING
ABANDONED
APARTMENTS
FOR
NONPERISHABLE
SUPPLIES
AND
TRAPPING
THE
OCCASIONAL
INFECTED
SO
AS
TO
HAVE
A
NEW
TRIAL
SUBJECT
FOR
HIS
LABORATORY
<S>
SMITH
IS
SIMPLY
DAZZLING
HERE
AND
FOR
ALL
THE
UNDENIABLY
IMPRESSIVE
WORK
THE
ACTOR
HAS
DONE
ON
HIS
PHYSIQUE
FOR
THIS
ROLE
WHAT'S
MOST
APPEALING
ABOUT
HIM
IS
HIS
ACTIVE
INTELLIGENCE HOW
HE
THINKS
HIS
WAY
THROUGH
A
ROLE AND
HIS
CAPACITY
FOR
HUMAN
WEAKNESS
<S>
WATCH
HIM
ESPECIALLY
IN
THE
SCENE
WHERE
HE
NURSES
HIS
WOUNDED
CANINE
COMPANION
AND
LATER
WHEN
HE
REFUSES
TO
ABANDON
HIS
POST
TO
FOLLOW
FELLOW
DISEASE-FREE
SURVIVOR
ANNA
CITY
OF
GOD
STAR
ALICE
BRAGA
TO
A
SUPPOSED
SURVIVOR'S
COLONY
IN
WHERE
ELSE
VERMONT
IF
HE
JUST
STAYS
PUT
IN
HIS
LAB
HE
TELLS
HER
TESTING
ONE
VACCINE
AFTER
ANOTHER
HE'S
SURE
HE
CAN
PUT
THINGS
RIGHT
<S>
THERE'S
A
MANIC
EDGE
TO
NEVILLE
BY
THAT
POINT
AND
SMITH
MAKES
YOU
FEEL
EVERY
INCH
OF
HIS
IMPOTENT
RAGE
<S>
IN
WHAT
HAS
BEEN
A
PRETTY
REMARKABLE
CAREER
UP
TO
NOW
IT'S
THIS
PERFORMANCE
THAT
FULLY
AFFIRMS
SMITH
AS
ONE
OF
THE
GREAT
LEADING
MEN
OF
HIS
GENERATION
<S>
IF
AS
A
MOVIE
I
AM
LEGEND
IS
LESS
STYLISTICALLY
MIND-BLOWING
AND
INTELLECTUALLY
AMBITIOUS
THAN
LAST
YEAR'S
YULETIDE
DYSTOPIA
CHILDREN
OF
MEN
IT'S
NOT
FAR
OFF
<S>
THE
SCREENPLAY
SHREWDLY
CONDENSES
THE
PRE-PLAGUE
BACKSTORY
TO
BRIEF
STACCATO
FLASHBACKS
AND
MANAGES
TO
SHIFT
THE
EMPHASIS
OF
THE
NOVEL WHICH
WAS
ABOUT
HOW
NEVILLE
CAME
TO
BE
SEEN
AS
A
KIND
OF
MONSTER
BY
A
NEW
RACE
OF
NON-VAMPIRE
MUTANTS WITHOUT
DILUTING
ITS
POWER
<S>
HERE
THE
CRUX
OF
THE
NARRATIVE
IS
A
TIMELY
DIALECTICAL
ARGUMENT
BETWEEN
A
MAN
NEVILLE
WHO
PUTS
HIS
FAITH
IN
SCIENCE
AND
A
SOMEWHAT
FANATICAL
WOMAN
ANNA
WHO
PUTS
HERS
IN
GOD BOTH
OF
WHOM
APPEAR
BY
TURNS
MORE
FANATICAL
THAN
RIGHTEOUS
LAWRENCE'S
DIRECTION
TOO
IS
MORE
SUBDUED
AND
ARTFUL
THAN
YOU
EXPECT
TO
FIND
IN
A
HIGH-TICKET
HOLIDAY
BLOCKBUSTER
NOTWITHSTANDING
A
SMATTERING
OF
CHEAP
SHOCK
EDITS
AND
SOUND
EFFECTS
<S>
MORE
OFTEN
LAWRENCE
TAKES
THINGS
SLOW
AND
EASY
STAGING
MUCH
OF
THE
FILM
IN
LONG
DIALOGUE-FREE
HANDHELD
CAMERA
SHOTS
THAT
USE
SPACE
PRODUCTION
DESIGN
AND
INTRICATELY
LAYERED
SOUND
EFFECTS
TO
DELIVER
US
INTO
NEVILLE'S
DESOLATE
EXISTENCE
<S>
BUT
WHEN
THE
TIME
COMES
FOR
THE
INEVITABLE
SHOWDOWNS
BETWEEN
NEVILLE
AND
THE
INFECTED
LAWRENCE
IS
NO
SLOUCH
NOTABLY
WITH
AN
INGENIOUS
STANDOFF
IN
WHICH
A
WINNOWING
BAND
OF
DAYLIGHT
IS
ALL
THAT
SEPARATES
NEVILLE
AND
HIS
POOCH
FROM
ALMOST
CERTAIN
DOOM
<S>
IF
I'VE
SAVED
MENTION
OF
THOSE
SCENES
FOR
LAST
IT'S
ONLY
BECAUSE
LAWRENCE LIKE
PETER
JACKSON
AND
JAMES
CAMERON
IS
AMONG
THE
FEW
FILMMAKERS
WITH
FULL
ACCESS
TO
THE
DIGITAL
PAINTBOX
WHO
SEEMS
TO
UNDERSTAND
HOW
THOSE
TOOLS
WORK
BEST
TO
MAGNIFY
THE
HUMAN
DIMENSION
OF
A
MOVIE
INSTEAD
OF
EXTINGUISH
IT
<S>
WHAT
MAKES
A
BEAUTY

SO
GREAT
IS
THAT
IT
REALLY
IS
A
MICROCOSM

WHOSE
MISPRONUNCIATION
OF
THE

IS
JUST
HILARIOUS

CRINGE-INDUCING

IN

CONTEMPT
THE
FIRST
HALF
OF

SOLONDZ'S
STRONGEST
FILMMAKING

WAS
A
COMEDY
OF

THIS

AND
HAVING

I'D
GUESS
WERE
LIBERALS TO

THAT
OF

IT
WOULD

THE

A

THAT

BE
READ
AS

<S>
SOLONDZ'S

THE

BECAUSE

IT'S

PERTAINS
TO
WHAT
FORCED
HUMANITY
OFF

IN

IN

THE

SEEMS
TO
BE
MAKING
A
QUIET

FOR
TAKING
CLEAR-HEADED
RESPONSIBILITY
FOR

A

TO

HIS

OVER
A

ACCOMPANIMENT
OF
UNEARTHLY

SIZZLES
AND
THE

ARE

ASSURES

WERE

I
KNEW
<S>
I
FINALLY
FELT
LIKE
IT
WAS

TO

KURT
TALK
FOR
HIMSELF
SCHNACK
BUILT
THE

AROUND
KURT'S

SHOOTING
CONTEMPORARY

OF
THE
PACIFIC
NORTHWEST
TO

FACTUALLY
<S>
WHEN

NATIVE
REFERENCES
HIS

THERE'S
A

MONTAGE
<S>
UNBEKNOWNST
TO
THE

IT'S
RECENT
FOOTAGE
OF
THE
ACTUAL
PLACE
WHERE
COBAIN'S
DAD
WORKED
<S>
I
DIDN'T
WANT
TO
IDENTIFY
THE
LOCATIONS
AND
SAY
YES
THIS
IS
WHAT
HE'S
TALKING
ABOUT HIS
DAD'S
REAL
OFFICE
SAYS
SCHNACK
IN
BRYANT
PARK
WITH
AZERRAD
ONE
RECENT
AFTERNOON
<S>
SUBTLE
YES
BUT
THERE
ARE
TIMES
YOU'RE
LEFT
WONDERING
JUST
WHO
AND
WHAT
THE
FACES
AND
PLACES
ARE
<S>
I
GUESS
I
THOUGHT
PEOPLE
WOULD
JUST
ASSUME
THAT
OF
COURSE
WE
WENT
TO
THAT
LENGTH
<S>
I'M
KIND
OF
SURPRISED
WHEN
I
READ
SOMETHING
WHERE
THEY
THINK
WE
WENT
TO
A
RANDOM
LUMBER
MILL
<S>
NOPE ACTUAL
LUMBER
MILL
WHERE
HIS

WORKED
<S>
AND
THAT'S
KURT'S

THOSE
ARE

BUT
THE
FOOTAGE
ISN'T
THE
STAR THE
VOICE
IS
<S>
THERE
WASN'T
YOUTUBE
IN
THE
EARLY
90S
SO
COBAIN'S
SPEECH
ISN'T
A
FAMILIAR
PART
OF
HIS
MYTHOLOGY
<S>
HEARING
HIM
EXPOUND
WHILE
EATING
CEREAL
OR
SUCKING
ON
A
SMOKE
IT'S
EASY
TO
FORGET
THAT
THIS
IS
THE
VOICE
OF
THE
GEN-X

FOR
APATHETIC
KIDS

WHEN
WE

<S>
FRANCES
BEAN
HAD
JUST
BEEN
BORN
GRUNGE
WAS
A

KURT
WAS
CONTEMPLATIVE
CANDID
AND
LUCID ABLE
TO
REFLECT
ON
THE
FACTORS
THAT
WOULD
INEVITABLY
KILL
HIM
<S>
DRUGS
ARE
BAD
FOR
YOU
AND
THEY
WILL
FUCK
YOU
UP
<S>
I
JUST
KNEW
THAT
I
WOULD
EVENTUALLY
STOP
DOING
THEM
<S>
BEING
MARRIED
AND
HAVING
A
BABY
IS
A
REALLY
GOOD
INCENTIVE

<S>
IF

BUT
A
CLUE
TO
WHAT'S
ULTIMATELY
AWRY
IN

CAN
BE

IN

SEQUENCE
<S>
A

COMES

<S>
NOW
AN

A

BENEATH

<S>
HE
GIVES
SIMILARLY

THEY'RE
BEAUTIFULLY
UGLY

YOU
GET
THE
FEELING
THAT
THE

ISN'T

IS
ODD

KING'S

STRAIGHT

STRIPPED
AWAY

ZEALOT
AND
DARABONT
MAY
MEAN
HER
TO
REPRESENT
THE
FUNDAMENTALIST
EXTREMES
AT

IN
A
FEAR-BASED
AMERICA
BUT
LISTENING
TO
CARMODY

FOR
THE

IS
LIKE

STUCK

ALL

THE

THE

OF

THE

WHEN

GENERAL
SENTIMENT
HERE
IS
THAT
IF
THEY
COULD
DO
IT
ALL
OVER
AGAIN
THEY
WOULDN'T
HAVE
JOINED
THE

<S>
BUT
MORRIS
ALWAYS
HAS
MORE
COMPLEX

AMBITIOUS
GOALS
THAN
STRAIGHTFORWARD
PERSONAL
CONFESSIONS

SOMETHING
HE
TYPICALLY
AIMS
FOR
WITH

A
STARK
MATTER-OF-FACT
APPROACH
WOULD
SEEM
ALL
THAT'S
REQUIRED
WHEN

DETRACTS
FROM

PLACING
THEM
WITHIN

ELABORATE

<S>
THE
DIRECTOR

OBSERVATION
THAT
WITH

YOU
DON'T

OUTSIDE

THE

SPECIFIC

CERTAIN

OUT
OF

WIDELY
DISSEMINATED

CAN'T

CREATED

AROUND

OF

WHO
MAY
HAVE
BEEN
ISSUING

YES
MORRIS
SUGGESTS
THE
PAWNS
ON

HERE
WERE
GUILTY

THE
PEOPLE
WHO
FOSTERED
SUCH
BEHAVIOR
WERE
SMART
ENOUGH
NOT
TO
BE
CAUGHT

<S>
FOR
ALL
THE
FINER
INTELLECTUAL
POINTS
BEING
MADE
HOWEVER
STANDARD

IS
AN
ALMOST
CONTINUOUSLY

SIT
NOT
EVEN
SO
MUCH
BECAUSE
OF
THE
IMAGES
THEMSELVES
WHICH
WILL
BE
MORE

<S>

INTRIGUING

THAT
